# Unduck-EX

> DuckDuckGo's bang redirects are too slow. Add the following URL as a custom search engine to your browser. Enables all of DuckDuckGo's bangs to work, but much faster.

Unduck-EX is a fork of the original [unduck](https://github.com/T3-Content/unduck), with a few Quality of life improvements like being able to choose your default search engine and adding newer bangs to the list.

All the redirects happen client side, mean it is fast, the site is cache'd to reduce network requests.
